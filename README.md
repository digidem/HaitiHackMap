# HaitiHack

HaitiHack is an effort to help women from KOFAVIV in Haiti. This effort took place on
1/31/2013-2/4/2013 in Port au Prince, with an amazing team including locals and international
participants.

This repo has the front-end aspect of the project. Not very many details are shared here.
That's by design.
